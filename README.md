# CS255 Course Project Summary: 

The DriverPass project aimed to design and develop a system to help a small business manage their drivers, vehicles, students, training material, and course content in order to train students to become better drivers and pass the state driving tests. The system was intended to schedule, track, and run reports on their customers to see who is utilizing the system and how they are doing. The client was the small business operating the fleet of vehicles.

I believe that I understood the project scope well. I found myself stepping in the clients shoes, thinking about how I would design this application if I was the owner, or a user, of the DriverPass platform. 

If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on providing more detailed and specific requirements for the system. While I provided a good overview of the project and its purpose, there is room for improvement in terms of outlining specific details of what the system needs to do and how it will do it.

To interpret the user's needs and implement them into the system design, it is important to listen to the client's requirements, ask questions to clarify any uncertainties, and take into account any feedback provided throughout the design process. Considering the user's needs is crucial in designing a system that will be effective and efficient in addressing the client's business requirements. A system that meets the client's needs and is user-friendly can lead to increased user adoption and satisfaction.

When approaching software design, it is important to start with a clear understanding of the client's requirements and business goals. This can be achieved by conducting thorough research, gathering feedback, and documenting the system requirements. From there, it is important to consider the different components and features needed for the system and how they will work together. Design techniques and strategies such as prototyping, user testing, and agile development can also be useful in ensuring that the system meets the client's needs and is delivered on time and within budget.
